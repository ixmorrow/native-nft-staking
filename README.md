# native-nft-staking
This is a contract that allows users to stake an NFT in exchange for rewards in the form of SPL tokens! This is written in Native Rust. 
There is a sister program of this logic implemented in Anchor as well.

There is a testing script that will send transactions to the deployed contract on Devnet in the `ts` folder. Simply run `npm start` in that folder to run.
